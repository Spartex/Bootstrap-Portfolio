        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <img src="assets/images/Portfolio_image.jpg" class="my-image" alt="John Comodikes Portfolio Image">

         <p>    My name is John Comodikes (Pronounced COMO-DEE-KIS).
                I am originally born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa!
                
                <br>

                I currently live in Southern California in a city called Riverside! I currently work for the County of Riverside and have been in the IT Industry for over 10 years!
                
                <br>
                
                <p>I have worked from sales, to owning my own business, and now for the Government.
                My love for technology entices me to reach new heights and to learn new skills.

                <br>
                
                I am very grateful for the experience I have gained throughout my years, and look forward to what the future holds.
                I enjoy learning to code, build and collect computer parts, as well as, reading up on new technologies. My hopes are to transition my career into being a Full Stack Web Developer
                full time.

            </p>

            <br>

        <p>  In my spare time I enjoy gaming, playing soccer and building custom computer systems. I have previously worked in the retail industry as a computer salesman, 
             and enjoy interacting with people from all walks of life. I have also owned my own IT business and have met many great people along the way. 
             I love to share and gain experience from colleagues and clients I previously and currently work with. Technology is an everchanging 
             industry which continues to captivate my interest to further expand my knowledege and experience which is why Coding has always been a side hobby.
